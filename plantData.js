        care:"Hydrangeas need full sun, dappled sun, or partial shade. Not all types have the same sun tolerance. Choose a lightweight, high-quality potting mix (not soilless seed starting mix) and combine with compost. Water the entire soil until water drips out of the drainage holes. And the more sun exposure it has, the more water it needs. Hydrangeas do not tolerate temperature extremes, both scorching hot summers, and extremely harsh winters."

        description: "Caladium is known to have no stems. The elongated petioles support the leaves and rise straight from the underground tuber. A unique fact about this plant is that blooming is not quite frequent for them. If planted in convenient locations, caladium tends to produce some flowers, but only small ones.",

        care:"When grown indoors, they do best with lots of heat, bright but indirect light, and plenty of humidity. Caladium plants prefer indirect light or moderate shade indoors. Plant caladium in a rich, well-drained soil in the garden or in potting mix for containers, such as a damp mix of soil and peat. When leaves appear on the plant, water as needed to keep the soil evenly moist."
