Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start

My learning was focused on making a website using React that generates information about a plant in my data file. 
## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would use an API to generate different plants with information about them using this plant API: https://perenual.com/docs/api .
I would create a login option for people to add their plants and the care and why not a way for them to remind them when to water their plant for example.
